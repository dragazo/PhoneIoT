    <p>
        The PhoneIoT app allows you to access your mobile device's sensors from <a href="https://netsblox.org/" target="_blank">NetsBlox</a>, a block-based programming environment.
        This includes (if present on your device and enabled), location, accelerometer, compass, microphone volume, light level, camera, and more.
        Additionally, it converts your screen into an interactive user interface that is customizable from NetsBlox.
        For instance, you can add buttons, switches, and text boxes with custom behaviors that tie back to NetsBlox code running in your project.
        To connect to NetsBlox, simply press the "Connect" button; your device will then be accessible by the PhoneIoT service in NetsBlox under the name displayed at the top of the screen (in the pull-out menu).
